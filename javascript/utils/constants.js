export const tesla_message = `My internship at Tesla was my first time living out of the MidWest, moving all the way to Palo Alto, CA.  \
  I was a part of the Energy Products Software team.  I mostly worked on an internal web tool, created by my mentor, that the sales team \
  used to sell more Powerwalls.  The first month or two I made updates/improvements to the web tool to get my feet wet.  Then I switched \
  to making a web portal for customers to upload their load and/or solar data directly.  This saved the sales team several hours a week \
  due to the high frequency of potential clients sending in bad data that they would have to fix.  This portal clearly informed the customer \
  of any errors when they woule try and submit it and would require them to fix the errors before submission to the sales team.  The backend \
  is run with ruby on rails and the frontend is created with React; neither of which I had any experience with before the internship. I learned \
  a lot and had the time of my life during these 6 months.`;

export const rc_message = `My internship at Rockwell Collins was my first taste of working in industry and thus taught me many valuable lessons. \
  I was originally hired to work on making the changes and improvements the clients wanted for the MH-53E but due to contract issues it never \
  even got started during the 6 months that I was there.  For that reason I switched teams and worked on an automated testing framework for \
  the CH-47 Chinook.  Throughout all of Rockwell when it was time to test the software, they would send a couple engineers to the labs and \
  go through and manually click the bezels and check to see if the correct thing was displayed on the screen.  We fixed this issue by having \
  it compare what was on the display to saved images of what was correct.  This involved two major steps: updating the test scripts to compare \
  images instead of directing a user and capturing the images of what was correct. I knew this type of work isn't what I wanted to do full time, \
  but I still learned a lot and am grateful for the opportunity.`;

export const rose_message = `Rose Hulman is a small private engineering college in Terre Haute, IN.  It has been ranked #1 in undergraduate \
  engineering for 18 years in a row.  I participated in a program called Fast Track Calculus which is a 5 week program in the summer where you \
  take Calc 1, 2, and 3 and have it done before you even start your freshman year.  Spending every moment besides essentials of life doing \
  calculus was super challenging.  Looking back it was one of the best decisions of my life as it helped me miss two quarters of school for \
  co-ops and made me friendships that will last with me for the rest of my life.  It was also there that my friends conviced me to become a \
  Computer Science major.  One of my favorite areas in CS has been web developement which is why I decided to make my website (this) from scratch. \
  Also the topic that has gotten me the most excited was actually a math class: Deep Learning.  I am glad to be rid of the homework and tests but \
  miss my friends and the college atmosphere.`;

export const growing_up_message = `For 18 years, plus many transitions from the previous milestones you have read about, I have called \
  Greenville, IL my home.  It is a small rural town 1 hour east of St. Louis.  It is where I became the man I am today. I grew a rock solid \
  foundation of faith in Jesus Christ there. My family and friends that live there helped shape my character, morals, and beliefs. I gained a \
  strong work ethic by growing up/working on a dairy farm.  I developed a love of sports by playing and watching almost every single day. I \
  fostered a love for a plethora of different kinds of music whether it be country from the radio, hymns from church, today's hits from social \
  activities, or rap from locker rooms.  My childhood home still influences me to this day by my desire to live up to the standards set on me. \
  Even though I haven't lived there in a while, I like to think deep down I am still a farmboy from the MidWest. This place/people will always \
  have a special place in my heart.`;

export const epic_message = `Epic makes software for hospitals, doctor's offices, plus so many more health care facilities. Their campus is \
  in Madison, WI and they have dedicated to making it a magical place. Whether it is their wizarding, storybook, farm, or any other campus, it \
  is definitely a sight to see. I was on the team that made features for Social Care workers. I learned a lot about an industry I had no prior \
  experience in. Also, their server code was in a programming language no one uses anymore (M) and the frontend was in .NET. Epic believed in \
  getting the developers time shadowing their users to learn pain points first hand. The most significant of these trips was a 2 week trip to \
  install our app for a hospital in Finland! That was only my second time ever out of the country. While my co-workers and the campus was great, \
  I quickly learned the programming, business practices, and winters were not for me. So after a year of employment I began looking for other \
  opportunities.`;

export const appfolio_message = `Appfolio makes a web tool for property managers to use to help them manage their properties. Appfolio \
  believes AI is the next big technological gain to help push business forward. As such, I was on a team looking to drive the AI initiative: \
  Smart Maintenance. The end goal was to have a bot text with tenants to discover/triage what is wrong and dispatch the right person to solve \
  the maintenance problem. More specifically, my team worked on the rules that property managers would define to help our operators \
  (eventually the bot) know how to handle a work order. For example for different issues they can set the urgency and which vendor to \
  dispatch. I enjoyed working at Appfolio due to their culture and more modern development practices than my previous job (React, Ruby on \
  Rails, CI/CD, hackdays, retros). Due to COVID, a lot of my time was working remotely back at home in Illinois, but the times I lived in \
  Santa Barbara were a blast with both beaches and mountains.`;

export const married_life_message = `Florida has been the place of great choices. I followed my girlfriend-at-the-time here as she pursued her \
  dream of working for Disney. After a year of dating, I proposed to her in front of Magic Kingdom's castle. A year after that, we got married \
  with a small ceremony at Disney's Yacht and Beach Club. Following that, we honeymooned in Maui and it was the best trip ever. A few days after \
  we got back, we headed to Illinois to have the bigger reception with all of our family and friends. A few months after that, our new construction \
  house was finished and we moved in. Our big house was feeling a little empty for just the two of us, so we got a dog and named him Woody. \
  We have been married for a little over a year now and I am loving every second of it. We fill our days going out to the parks, restaurants, \
  and the beach. We also love to stay in and play Nintendo Switch, watch movies, cook together, and play board games. I am so grateful for my \
  wife and the life we are building together here in Florida.`;
