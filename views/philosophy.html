            When people think of computer scientists they think of unsocial people that lock themselves in a room and stay hunched over a computer until they have a product to share with the world.  The reality of the situation is that computer scientists have to be involved with much more than code to get what they envision out in the world.  They have to communicate with various types of people and in many different forms.  In this philosophy on communication I will explain my skills in two of these forms of communication: presenting and writing reports.<br> <br>
            One type of communication I excel in is presenting final specifications of a project.  These final presentations need to be informative yet exciting to keep the audience from getting bored.  Throughout my time at Rose Hulman and in industry I have had many projects and most of them require a final presentation at the end. Specifically, abstract one is a PowerPoint used to present what I worked on at Rockwell Collins. That abstract shows my effectiveness at presenting the import details for the audience to understand how my project works but doesn't include unnecessary information that doesn't benefit the audience at all.  For example, it includes names of commonly used functions to give the audience a general idea of what is going on but doesn't include the code for how the functions work.<br> <br>
            Another way I communicate well is by writing reports.  Many times in industry computer scientists have to research new topics in the field and give their manager a report of their findings for the manager to decide whether they want to incorporate it into their project/product.  I have a lot of experience looking up new topics I have never used before and having to communicate to either a fellow student or a professor my findings.  As an example, artifact 2 shows this skill because I had to research information about the minimum wage and had to not only report the findings but use the findings to persuade the audience.<br> <br>
            Communication is imperative in computer science for the products to be made efficiently and quickly.  This e-portfolio does an excellent job showing my skills with communicating research results and final specifications on projects I have completed in the past.  As I continue to do more projects and spend more time in industry I will continue to refine my skills of communicating clearly and effectively.
