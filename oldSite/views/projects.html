            This PowerPoint was used to showcase what I did during my co-op at Rockwell Collins.  It was used in a presentation to a coworker for him to learn more about what I did and for him to determine if he could incorporate it into his program.  What I worked on was converting a testing framework from manual to automated.  The advantages of doing this are shown on slide 7.  This PowerPoint shows my ability to communicate clearly what I did but not give him filler information.  The project takes a lot of time so for him to commit to switching to that framework is a risk.  Thus, on each slide I gave him info necessary for him to grasp the concepts of what I was doing without bogging him down with info that doesn't affect his decision.  As a result, this skill will translate well into my future employments because there are many times employees have to give their managers quick presentations about where they are in a project and what they did.  Also, this exact scenario of presenting what I did for a coworker/other manager to decide if they want to incorporate it into their area of the company would be very likely to occur again.

            This technical report was used to showcase my final project in Computer Architecture during the fall quarter of my sophomore year.  This project was accomplished with 3 other computer science major students.  In it we implemented a 16 bit processor.  My role in the project was to design the layout of the processor.  Specifically, I had to design what component connected with what and I had to implement in what order parts of the processor were executed.  The resulting design layout is shown on page 5.  Even though the audience of the presentation was the professor who had the more knowledge than I, each team made their processor in a different way.  Hence, I had to clearly articulate how our processor would execute a given instruction for the audience to understand.  As a result, this will translate well for me in industry because after a project is complete, I will have to explain to the other team members/bosses the basic principals of how my project works in a clear and concise way.  Furthermore, this report shows my ability to clearly show the important details of the project for others to understand.  For more information or questions about this project feel free to contact me at laeschjs@rose-hulman.edu.

            This paper was written as an individual assignment in my Economics class during my freshman year at Rose-Hulman.  The paper was written to persuade the reader (in this case the professor) that the minimum wage should be increased.  I did this by giving the side effects, both good and bad, of raising the minimum wage.  I then proceeded to explain why the good benefits outweighed the bad.  When words weren't sufficient for giving the information, I included a picture as shown on page 1.  This paper shows my ability to communicate clearly the facts of a situation both to an audience who knows a lot about the subject and to an audience that knows little.  This will translate well for me in industry when I am required to do research on a new tool or strategy for the company and I need to write a report of my findings.  The report could be read by high up managers who know little about the subject but it could also be read by senior engineers who may have some knowledge already.  This paper also shows my ability to do proper research and citation.  For example, on page 2 I have used a relevant, trustworthy website and properly cited it.  For more information feel free to contact me at laeschjs@rose-hulman.edu.
